## Test Strategy


Summary of Recommended Test Strategy:
The codebase has a high level of modularity and reusability, making it easier to test. However, there are still some areas where testing can be improved. Here's a suggested test strategy based on the codebase provided:

1. Unit tests: Write unit tests for individual functions, classes, or modules. For example, write unit tests for the `test_github_token_source` and `test_github_connect` functions to ensure that they are working correctly.
2. Integration tests: Test the integration of different components of the codebase. For example, test the integration between the `ollama_code_llama` module and the `http_api` module.
3. Functional tests: Write functional tests that simulate real-world usage scenarios. For example, write a functional test to ensure that the CLI is working correctly when providing arguments for the `server` command.
4. Acceptance tests: Write acceptance tests that verify the functionality of the codebase as a whole. For example, write an acceptance test to ensure that the `OllamaApp` class is working correctly and that the CLI is displaying the correct information.
5. Edge case testing: Test the edge cases of the codebase, such as testing the behavior of the code when the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is not set or when an invalid token is provided.
6. Security testing: Perform security testing to ensure that the codebase is secure and does not have any vulnerabilities.

Suggestions for missing or weak test cases:
1. Write test cases for the `OllamaApp` class to ensure that it is working correctly and that the CLI is displaying the correct information.
2. Test the behavior of the `ollama_code_llama` module when an invalid token is provided or when the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is not set.
3. Write test cases for the `http_api` module to ensure that it is working correctly and that the HTTP API endpoints are returning the correct information.
4. Test the behavior of the CLI when providing arguments for the `server` command, such as testing the `--help` flag or the `--version` flag.
5. Test the behavior of the CLI when providing arguments for the `reports` command, such as testing the `--list` flag or the `--generate` flag.
6. Test the behavior of the CLI when providing arguments for the `config` command, such as testing the `--list` flag or the `--set` flag.
7. Test the behavior of the CLI when providing arguments for the `logs` command, such as testing the `--list` flag or the `--tail` flag.
8. Test the behavior of the CLI when providing arguments for the `exit` command, such as testing that the CLI exits correctly and that the correct exit code is returned.
9. Test the behavior of the CLI when providing invalid arguments, such as testing that the CLI displays an error message when an invalid argument is provided.
10. Test the behavior of the CLI when providing multiple arguments at once, such as testing that the CLI processes the arguments correctly and that the correct output is displayed.

Example test cases:
1. `test_github_token_source` function:
```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

def test_load_dotenv():
    load_dotenv()
    assert os.environ.get('GITHUB_TOKEN') is not None
```
2. `test_github_connect` function:
```python
import os
from github import Github

def test_connect_to_github():
    token = os.environ.get('GITHUB_TOKEN')
    assert token is not None
    try:
        g = Github(token)
        user = g.get_user()
        assert user.login == 'yourusername'
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'Failed to connect to GitHub: {e}')
```
3. `test_ollama_code_llama` class:
```python
import requests
from ollama_code_llama import OllamaCodeLlama

def test_ollama_code_llama():
    llama = OllamaCodeLlama()
    assert llama.get_response("hello") == "Ollama 7B Code Llama: Hello!"
```
4. `test_http_api` class:
```python
import requests
from http_api import HttpApi

def test_http_api():
    api = HttpApi()
    assert api.get_response("hello") == "Ollama 7B Code Llama: Hello!"
```
5. `test_cli` class:
```python
import os
from cli import Cli

def test_cli():
    cli = Cli()
    args = ["server"]
    assert cli.run(args) == 0
```

# Ollama 7B Code Llama Python Project

## Introduction
Our project is a wrapper for the [7B Code Llama](https://ollama.com/docs/models/codellama) model from Ollama, an AI-powered code auditing tool. We provide an HTTP API and command-line interface (CLI) to simplify the integration of our project into your workflow.

## Features
Our project offers the following features:
* Text-based code analysis for bugs and improvements suggestions.
* File-based code analysis for bugs and improvements suggestions.
* Filtering files before audit.
* Configuring the output directory.
* Automated testing of the CLI and API.
* Integration with other open source projects.

## Setup
To set up our project, you will need to install Python 3.6 or later and clone this repository. Then, follow these steps:
1. Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project directory.
2. Configure secrets for your GitHub token (see configuration and secrets loading order below).
3. Start the Flask API server by running `python http_api.py`.
4. Check if the LLM is running by sending a `GET` request to `/health`.

## Configuration and Secrets Loading Order
We use environment variables for configuration and secrets loading order, with higher precedence given to later configurations. Here's an example of each:
1. Environment Variables: Use the following environment variables in your `.env` file or in your system's environment variables:
* `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub token for accessing private repos.
* `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_PORT`, `MYSQL_USERNAME`, and `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: Credentials for connecting to a MySQL database (optional).
2. .env File: Create an `.env` file in the project directory with the following variables:
* `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub token for accessing private repos.
* `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_PORT`, `MYSQL_USERNAME`, and `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: Credentials for connecting to a MySQL database (optional).
3. Configuration File: Create a configuration file in the project directory named `config.yaml`. The following variables are supported:
* `github_token`: Your GitHub token for accessing private repos.
* `mysql_host`, `mysql_port`, `mysql_username`, and `mysql_password`: Credentials for connecting to a MySQL database (optional).
4. Secrets File: Create a secrets file in the project directory named `secrets.yaml`. The following variables are supported:
* `github_token`: Your GitHub token for accessing private repos.

## Usage Examples
We provide several usage examples below to help you get started with our project.
### 1. Generate a GitHub Audit Report (Full Workflow)
```
$ python cli.py
? Main Menu: Generate GitHub Report
? GitHub token: <your_token>
? GitHub repo (e.g. user/repo): psf/requests
? Branch (leave blank for default): master
? PR number (leave blank if not analyzing a PR):
? What do you want to audit?: All code files
? Would you like to filter which files to include in the audit?: Yes
? Filter files by: Pattern (glob/regex)
? Enter glob pattern (e.g. *.py, src/*.js): *.py
? Output directory for reports and README? (default: reports): my_audits
? Open full report in your editor before saving?: No
? Save the updated README as a separate file?: Yes
```
- The audit runs in parallel, showing a progress bar.
- The report and updated README are saved in `my_audits/`.

### 2. Audit Only Changed Files in a PR
```
? Main Menu: Generate GitHub Report
? ...
? PR number (leave blank if not analyzing a PR): 123
? What do you want to audit?: Only changed files (for PR)
```
- Only files changed in PR #123 are analyzed.

### 3. Audit README Only
```
? Main Menu: Generate GitHub Report
? ...
? What do you want to audit?: README only
```
- Only the README is analyzed and improved.

### 4. Run Automated CLI Test
```
? Main Menu: Run automated test
```
- Runs a full audit on a public repo and checks for all key report sections.

### 5. Upload a Report to an API
```
? Main Menu: Upload report to API
? Directory containing report? (default: reports): my_audits
? Select report to upload: github_audit_psf_requests_master.md
? API endpoint URL: https://my-api.example.com/upload
? Add custom headers (e.g., API key)?: Yes
? Header key (leave blank to finish): X-API-KEY
? Value for X-API-KEY: myapikey123
? Send as: JSON (report as string)
```
- The report is POSTed to the specified API endpoint with custom headers.

### 6. Use Parallel Analysis & Caching
- On first run, all files are analyzed in parallel (progress bar shown).
- On rerun, cached results are used for unchanged files, speeding up the audit.

### 7. Filter Files Before Audit
- When prompted, choose to filter files by pattern (e.g., `*.py`) or manual selection.
- Only selected files are included in the audit and report.

### 8. Set Output Directory
- When prompted, enter a directory name (e.g., `my_audits`).
- All reports and updated READMEs will be saved there.

## Tips & Best Practices
We recommend the following tips for using our project:
1. **Use a valid GitHub token** with appropriate scopes for private repos and higher rate limits.
2. **Use file filtering** to focus audits on relevant code (e.g., skip vendor or test files).
3. **Leverage caching** by rerunning audits after small changes—only changed files are re-analyzed.
4. **Preview and edit reports** before saving for maximum control.
5. **Automate validation** with the built-in CLI test runner.
6. **Upload reports** to your own API or dashboard for team review.
