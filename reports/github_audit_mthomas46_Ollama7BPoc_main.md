## Test Strategy


The codebase consists of a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. The current test strategy is not very effective in testing the complete functionality of the calculator. Therefore, we will develop a new test strategy that includes both unit tests and integration tests to cover more aspects of the codebase. We will also include test cases for edge conditions such as zero division, negative numbers, etc.

Unit Testing:
The unit tests should be performed on each component of the calculator separately to ensure that they work correctly. This includes testing the individual buttons, the display, and the arithmetic operations. Each component should have its own set of test cases that cover various scenarios such as valid input, invalid input, edge cases, etc.

Integration Testing:
The integration tests will be performed on the entire calculator system to ensure that all components work together correctly. This includes testing the user interface, the arithmetic operations, and the display. Integration tests should also cover any edge cases such as zero division, negative numbers, etc.

Example Test Cases:

1. Unit Testing:
a. Testing the "+" button on a calculator with both positive and negative numbers.
b. Testing the "/" button on a calculator with different divisors to ensure that the correct result is obtained.
c. Testing the display of a calculator with different numbers and operations to ensure that it displays the correct value.
2. Integration Testing:
a. Testing the user interface of a calculator with both positive and negative numbers and edge cases such as zero division, negative numbers, etc.
b. Testing the arithmetic operations of a calculator with different operands and edge cases such as divide by zero, negative numbers, etc.
c. Testing the display of a calculator with different numbers and operations to ensure that it displays the correct value.

Notes on Test Coverage:
The current test strategy is not very effective in testing the complete functionality of the codebase. Therefore, we will need to include more test cases to cover all aspects of the codebase. We will also need to add test cases for edge conditions such as zero division, negative numbers, etc.

Improvements:
The current test strategy can be improved by including unit tests and integration tests to cover more aspects of the codebase. Additionally, we can include test cases for edge conditions such as zero division, negative numbers, etc. to ensure that the calculator works correctly in all scenarios. By following a test-driven development approach, we can continuously improve the test coverage and ensure that the codebase is robust and maintainable.
