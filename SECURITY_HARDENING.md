# Security Hardening Report

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security hardening measures implemented in the LlamalyticsHub application to ensure production-ready security standards.

## üîí Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **File Upload Validation**: Comprehensive validation for uploaded files including:
  - File size limits (2MB maximum)
  - File type restrictions (only allowed text file extensions)
  - Path traversal attack prevention
  - Filename sanitization
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent:
  - Null byte injection
  - Control character injection
  - XSS attacks
  - SQL injection (if applicable)
- **Length Limits**: Strict limits on input lengths to prevent DoS attacks

### 2. Rate Limiting
- **IP-based Rate Limiting**: 60 requests per minute per IP
- **Thread-safe Implementation**: Uses threading locks for concurrent access
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old requests are automatically cleaned up
- **429 Response**: Proper HTTP 429 responses for rate limit exceeded

### 3. Security Headers
All responses include comprehensive security headers:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - XSS protection
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` - HSTS
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'` - CSP
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Referrer policy

### 4. Error Handling & Logging
- **Structured Logging**: All security events are logged with context
- **Error Sanitization**: Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- **Exception Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with proper HTTP status codes
- **Security Monitoring**: Bot detection and suspicious activity logging

### 5. File System Security
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: All file operations are protected against path traversal
- **Directory Traversal Protection**: Secure file path validation
- **File Type Validation**: Only allowed file types can be uploaded
- **Size Limits**: Strict file size limits to prevent DoS

### 6. API Security
- **Request Validation**: All API requests are validated using Pydantic models
- **Response Sanitization**: Sensitive data is filtered from responses
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- **Trusted Host Middleware**: Protection against host header attacks

### 7. Authentication & Authorization
- **API Key Support**: Optional API key authentication
- **Bearer Token Support**: HTTP Bearer token authentication
- **Token Validation**: Secure token validation without exposing tokens in logs

### 8. Log Security
- **Sensitive Data Filtering**: Tokens, passwords, and API keys are filtered from logs
- **Limited Log Access**: Only last 100 lines are accessible via API
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic log rotation with size limits
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive audit trail for security events

### 9. GitHub Integration Security
- **Token Validation**: GitHub tokens are validated before use
- **Repository Validation**: Repository names are validated against regex patterns
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling for GitHub API failures
- **Input Sanitization**: All GitHub-related inputs are sanitized

### 10. Report Security
- **File Path Validation**: All report file paths are validated
- **Content Security**: Report content is served with proper security headers
- **Access Control**: Reports are only accessible from the reports directory
- **Encoding Validation**: File encoding is validated to prevent attacks

- [x] Output sanitization implemented
- [x] Rate limiting configured
- [x] Security headers added
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] Logging configured
- [x] File upload security implemented
- [x] Authentication support added
- [x] CORS configured
- [x] HTTPS headers added

### Recommended Production Settings
1. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   OLLAMA_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token
   OLLAMA_LOG_FILE=/var/log/llamalyticshub.log

## üîß Security Configuration

### Rate Limiting
```python
# Current: 60 requests per minute per IP
rate_limiter = RateLimiter(requests_per_minute=60)
```

### File Upload Limits
```python
# Current: 2MB maximum file size
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 2 * 1024 * 1024  # 2MB
```

### Allowed File Types
```python
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {
    '.txt', '.py', '.js', '.java', '.cpp', '.c', 
    '.h', '.md', '.json', '.xml', '.yaml', '.yml'
}
```
