However, there are some potential issues with the file structure and organization that may be worth noting for future improvements. For example, the \"Features\" section is quite long and contains a lot of information about the project's capabilities. This section could potentially be split up into smaller sections to make the README more manageable.", "suggestions": "(with code examples if file is small): One potential improvement could be to add a brief description of each feature in the \"Features\" section, rather than including a table with a mix of bullet points and descriptions. This would make the section easier to read and understand. For example:\n```markdown\n## Features", "code_example": "## Features\n\n* Local LLM API: Run and interact with the 7B Code Llama model locally via Ollama\n* Modern CLI: Interactive CLI with rich UI, arrow-key navigation, and spinners\n* Audit Scope Selection: Choose to audit all files, changed files (PR), README only, or test strategy only", "code_smells": "or anti-patterns: None that I could identify based on a quick review of the file. However, it's always a good idea to double-check the README for any potential issues or inaccuracies.", "security_performance": "", "test_coverage": ""}
