## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Docker Containerization

#### Security Benefits:
- **Isolation:** Application runs in isolated containers
- **Non-root user:** Containers run as non-root user
- **Resource limits:** Memory and CPU limits enforced
- **Network isolation:** Internal Docker networks
- **Read-only filesystems:** Where possible

#### Implementation:
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for security
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
# ... build stage

FROM python:3.11-slim as production
# Create non-root user
RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser appuser
USER appuser
```

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization

#### File Upload Security:
```python
def validate_file_upload(file):
    """Validate uploaded file for security"""
    # Check file size (2MB limit)
    # Check file extension (whitelist)
    # Check for path traversal
    # Validate UTF-8 encoding
```

#### Input Sanitization:
```python
def sanitize_input(text):
    """Basic input sanitization"""
    # Remove null bytes
    # Limit length (10KB)
    # Validate encoding
```

### 3. Rate Limiting

#### Implementation:
```python
class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, requests_per_minute=60):
        self.requests_per_minute = requests_per_minute
        self.requests = defaultdict(list)
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
```

#### Applied to:
- `/generate/text` endpoint
- `/generate/file` endpoint  
- `/generate/github-pr` endpoint

### 4. Enhanced Authentication

#### API Key Validation:
```python
@app.before_request
def require_api_key():
    # Log API key presence (not value)
    # Validate API key format
    # Rate limit based on key
```

### 5. Secure Configuration Management

#### Environment Variables:
```bash
# Production configuration
OLLAMA_API_KEY=your_secure_api_key_here
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
FLASK_ENV=production
```

#### Docker Secrets:
```yaml
# Use Docker secrets in production
secrets:
  - ollama_api_key
  - github_token
```

### 6. Network Security

#### Nginx Reverse Proxy:
```nginx
# Security headers
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;

# Rate limiting
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api:10m rate=10r/s;
```

### 7. Logging Security

#### Secure Logging:
```python
# Don't log sensitive data
log_info(__name__, "API key provided", "***", feature=__name__, file=request.path)

# Rotate logs automatically
logger.add(LOG_FILE, rotation="10 MB", retention="10 days", compression="zip")
```

## Security Testing

### Automated Tests

#### 1. File Upload Testing:
```bash
# Test malicious file uploads
curl -X POST -F "file=@malicious.php" http://localhost:5000/generate/file
# Expected: 400 Bad Request
```

#### 2. Rate Limiting Testing:
```bash
# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"prompt":"test"}' http://localhost:5000/generate/text
done
# Expected: 429 Too Many Requests after limit
```

#### 3. Input Validation Testing:
```bash
# Test path traversal
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/reports/../../../etc/passwd"
# Expected: 400 Bad Request
```
